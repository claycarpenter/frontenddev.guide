# Organization

How to organize the material in this site?

## Basic Material Types

I see three basic types of material:

* Theory - The Why? of the topic. Puts the topic/technology/component into the bigger picture, adds context.
* Practice - How to actually implement the theory. Practical implementation details. Lots of examples, but those examples are typically snippets rather than complete programs.
* Projects - Building something useful, even if they're "toy" projects. Something complete, functional, useful enough that it's worthy of its own GitHub repo or (multi-file) Gist.

## Organization Options

Given those basic types, what organizational options do I have available to present this material?

### Choose Your Own Adventure

Presents the information as indepdent sections that can be consumed in whatever sequence the reader desires.

Might overwhelm beginning users (unless there's a corresponding suggested path for beginners).


#### Theory

#### Practice

#### Projects


### Project-Based Approach

Focus on developing projects.

Concepts are introduced at the beginning of each project. "This is what the project does, and this is what we're going to learn, and this is why these items are important."

### Path-Based Approach

Weaves in and out of theory, practice, and projects types, giving the user a guided lesson in front end development.

Probably the best fit for a beginner.

Would likely result in a rigid document structure, which might make it hard to change as the site becomes more and more complete.
