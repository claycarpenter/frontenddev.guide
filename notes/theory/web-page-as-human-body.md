Using the human body as an analogy to describe how HTML, CSS, and JS interact to form a complete web page.

If a web page is a human body, then:
* HTML is the bone structure. HTML provides the underlying structure for everything in a web page.
* CSS is the skin, the hair, the flesh--the clothes? CSS is the beautiful and changeable appearance on top of the bones and muscle of HTML and JS.
* JS is the muscle and the brain--it handles the working and the thinking.
