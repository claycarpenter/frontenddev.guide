HTML is how you mark up content.

HTML allows the browser to answer questions like this:
* What is the title of the document?
* What text is inside the document? How is that text organized?
* Where does this link point to?
* Where do I find the source for this image?

In the holy trinity of web development, HTML may not seem as important or sexy as CSS or JavaScript. CSS can make a page look stunning, and JS does let you build incredibly rich applications. But at the heart of any compelling web experience is good content, and HTML is what defines that content and makes it useful.
