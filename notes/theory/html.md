## Approach

This extends beyond just the HTML Theory section, but in general I think the HTML-related pages should focus on two things: clean, semantic markup and HTML5 elements. I expect that many times those two items will overlap. Clean, semantic markup is the theory, HTML5 elements are how they're achieved. Even though HTML5 doesn't have comprehensive support among all browsers, it's still widely supported enough that it's usable today, and people who are picking up HTML for the first time (or brushing up on their fundamentals) should focus a bit more into the future as that's when they'll be professionally applying their skills.

If focusing on HTML5 elements and semantic markup, it'd be a good idea to cover how browsers deal with elements they don't recognize. For instance, the `dialog` element [isn't currently recognized by Safari](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/native-popups-and-modals-with-the-html5-dialog-element--cms-23876), so how does Safari handle that? What polyfill/fallback/gracefull degradation should be applied?

## Text

HTML is how you mark up content.

HTML allows the browser to answer questions like this:
* What is the title of the document?
* What text is inside the document? How is that text organized?
* Where does this link point to?
* Where do I find the source for this image?

In the holy trinity of web development, HTML may not seem as important or sexy as CSS or JavaScript. CSS can make a page look stunning, and JS does let you build incredibly rich applications. But at the heart of any compelling web experience is good content, and HTML is what defines that content and makes it useful.

This seems like a good article to reference to help convey the importance of clean HTML markup to a site's design.

Good outline of HTML5, and excellent example of how to present that material clearly.
