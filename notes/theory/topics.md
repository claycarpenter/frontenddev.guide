# Theory Topics Notes

## Intermediate

* AJAX

## Advanced

* PaaS
* Semantic Markup
* Accessibility
* Optimization
* Software Testing - Separate unit and integration testing?
* HTTP & REST
* Source Control

* Command Line

## Basic Outline

A basic outline of what should be in every theory section. This doesn't need to be followed strictly, but should serve to guide and structure the article.

* What is it?
* Why do I need it?
* How do I use it? Examples of usage are likely to be difficult to concisely demonstrate or document. Perhaps graphics/infographics could illustrate the point?
* Where can I learn more?
